# ATTENTIFY




## Inspiration
One of our team members, Aiden, has ADHD. We were moved when he shared his perspective and story. So, we created this app to help people like Aiden track time effectively and be more productive. 🔥🌟

## What it does
Attentify is a specialized productivity tool designed specifically for individuals with ADHD. It aims to assist them in managing their tasks and improving their focus and study habits. The core features of Attentify include:

- **Effortless Note-Taking:** A user-friendly note-taking system that allows for the quick creation, editing, and organization of notes, ideal for capturing thoughts and ideas spontaneously. 📝🎨
- **Pomodoro Timer Integration:** Incorporates the Pomodoro technique, facilitating focused work sessions interspersed with short breaks. This feature is particularly beneficial in managing attention spans and preventing fatigue. 🍅⏳
- **AI-Powered Assistance:** Includes an AI assistant that simplifies complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps, aiding users in overcoming the overwhelm often associated with large or daunting tasks. 🤖🚀
- **Calendar Functionality:** A calendar feature for visual scheduling and time management, helping reinforce routine and organization, which can be particularly helpful for individuals with ADHD. 📅🌈

Overall, Attentify is beneficial for its targeted approach to the specific challenges faced by those with ADHD, offering practical solutions to enhance productivity, focus, and overall task management. 🚀✨

## How we built it
We built it with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. 💻🔧

## Challenges we ran into
We encountered challenges while connecting OpenAI to our backend and frontend. We overcame these challenges by persevering, even when we were burnt out and felt like quitting. Additionally, we faced challenges using CSS to align and format our complex plans. We overcame this through research and leveraging each other's specific skills. 🤔💡

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating an app prototype that could one day help many people who suffer from procrastination and time management issues, especially members of the ADHD community. 🏆🎉

## What we learned
We learned how to work as a team, both technically through GitHub and emotionally by considering each other's strengths, weaknesses, and feelings. 🤝🧠

## What's next for Attentify
1. **A Phone App:**
   - The phone app will have an alarm system that requires you to input a code into a computer to turn it off. This incentivizes the user to take the first step to begin working again after too many breaks. 📱🔒
2. **Reminder System:**
   - Collects both focus data and notifies the user to stay focused.
   - Provides focus statistics at the end of each month to help the user find times in their day where they are most productive. 📊🔔
3. **Accountability Partner/Streaks:**
   - Implement a friend system where you and your buddies can hold 'productivity streaks' where you both simultaneously are hitting your set goals. 👫📈



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
